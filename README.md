## 📍 Overview
This repository contains a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a Fitness Tracker web application. This application allows users to set fitness goals, track their progress, and share their achievements online. The application is built using a React frontend, a simplified Node.js backend, and MongoDB Atlas for data storage. It's designed to be a user-friendly platform for fitness enthusiasts to monitor their progress.
